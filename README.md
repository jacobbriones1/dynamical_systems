# Dynamical Systems Simulations in Python
---
A library containing many different programs to simulate dynamical systems in python using mainly matplotlib. Almost all can be run in IDLE, or for example in a command prompt by running:
```
python lorenz_system.py
```

### Improced Predator Prey Population Dynamics
Dynamic simulation of predator prey populations which uses the Lotka-Volterra Equations, but accounts for time lags between population increases, and efficiencies of each species.
